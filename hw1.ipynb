    "# CS 375 Homework 1: Spam via Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to use regular expressions (`RegExes`) to extract phone numbers and email addresses from documents found on the web. \n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem easy at first, as you can write simple `RegExes` to catch typical cases such as `101-867-5309` or `kak5@williams.edu`. However, there are many ways people write their emails in the `HTML` files for their personal websites. Some do this to prevent scrapers from capturing them easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you really were a malicious actor, you could then use these extracted addresses to bombard unsuspecting victims with spam! Of course, we would never do anything nefarious like that in `CS 375`. Instead our goal will be to work with raw data and gain some experience with `RegExes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Optional but recommended:* Before you begin this assignment, we have provided a tutorial about regular expressions in Python. Open `regular_expressions_tutorial.ipynb` in this same repository to begin. "

    "\n",
    "Execute the code cells in Part 1 to understand the background for this assignment. You will not need to modify or add anything to Part 1. Part 2 is where your solution begins. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Part 1: Background.**\n",
    "* 1A. Environment set-up \n",
    "* 1B. Data exploration \n",
    "* 1C. Evaluation \n",
    "* 1D. Cases to consider \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Your solution.** This is where you will write `RegExes` to find phone numbers and email addresses by modifying the following two functions: \n",
    "- `find_phone_numbers()`\n",
    "- `find_emails()` \n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional instructions.**\n",
    "- Your submitted solution and code must be yours alone. Copying and pasting a solution from the internet or another source is considered a violation of the honor code. \n",
    "- However, you can talk to classmates about *high-level* approaches. In the **Process Reporting** section, record the names of any classmates you spoke with about this assignment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like many real-world NLP systems, your submission will be evaluated on `precision` and `recall`. To review, \n",
    "- We evaluate precision and recall by comparing `true positives (tp)`, `false positives (fp)`, and `false negatives (fn)`. \n",
    "- `precision = tp/(tp+fp)`\n",
    "- `recall = tp/(tp+fn)`\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be evaluated on the \"harmonic mean\" of precision and recall call the `F1-score`\n",
    "- `F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)`\n",
    "- Like precision and recall, the range of F1 is [0, 1] with a higher number indicating a better system. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **90 points:** This portion of your grade reflects how well your submission performs on the `development (dev) set`, for which you have all the gold-standard answers. Your grade for this portion is calculated as \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (F1 on dev set) * 90 points\n",
    "    ``` \n",
    "- **10 points:** This portion of your grade reflects how well your submission performs on the held-out `test set`. Like real-world NLP systems, a \"good\" system is one that generalizes well \"in the wild.\" We emulate this via a \"test set.\" For the test set, you will not have access to the gold-standard answers. However, unlike real-world NLP systems, we will provide your score on the held-out test set on Gradescope so you can assess your own generalization performance. You can resubmit to Gradescope as many times as you would like. Your final grade will be \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (F1 on the test set) * 10 points\n",
    "    ``` \n",
    "    After all student solutions have been submitted and graded, we will release the test set so that you can inspect it and learn from your mistakes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission.** \n",
    "Once you have completed Parts 1 and 2, run the final cell in this notebook. This will create `submission.zip` which you will then upload to Gradescope. "
